## About Me:
I’m a developer with a background in **SDK support** and a deep passion for **mobile application development**. My journey in programming started with helping developers integrate and troubleshoot SDKs, which led me to realize my true interest in **building products** myself. I’m now focusing on **React Native** to create powerful, user-friendly apps.

In addition to my technical expertise, I’m a **yoga enthusiast**. This has inspired me to build the **Yoga Studio App**, a project that merges my love for **technology** and **wellness**.
